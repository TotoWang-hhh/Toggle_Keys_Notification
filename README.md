# Toggle Keys Notification

### Description

A python script that shows a notification when **Caps Lock** or **Num Lock** keys are pressed. It is useful for people that don't have **LEDs** on their keyboards. 

### Top-left notification

use `top-left_notify.py` if you want to have a try.

When you press <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> or <kbd>NumLock</kbd>, you'll see a small notification window on the top-left corner.

(the bottom-middle one is from my laptop)
